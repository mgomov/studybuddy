<p>
StudyBuddy's not done yet! Things can -- and will -- change, especially in terms of user experience. We know things are rough around the edges and it's not all too intuitive yet. 
</p>

<p>First things first, <a href="sb-dl/StudyBuddy.zip">here's the folder</a>  you'll have to open with StudyBuddy. Unzip that somewhere (like your Documents). </p>

<p>When you Unzip it, you should see something like this in your file explorer:</p>

<img src="images/sb_structure.png"></img>

<p>You'll need to put all the data (images, audio) you use for StudyBuddy in the data folder.</p>

<p>For now, StudyBuddy supports: </p>
<ul>
	<li>.mp3</li>
	<li>.m4a</li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Supported_media_formats">(Potentially, any audio format that the HTML5 audio player supports)</a></li>
	<li>.jpg</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Now, open up your StudyBuddy app. You should see something like this if you move your mouse over to the left: </p>		

<img src="images/sb_load.png"></img>

<p>If you downloaded the .zip from above, you won't see any of the notes or the window with a picture; you'll have to add your own recordings later.</p>
		
<p>Let's look closer at the individual parts:</p>

<img src="images/sb_load_close.png"></img>

<p>This is where you'll load your recordings up once you've put them into StudyBuddy. First, you pick a directory (the StudyBuddy directory that you downloaded will work), and then you'll see all the recordings that were found there.</p>
		
<p>Mouse over a recording to see details on it; click on it to lock that window and either edit its details, load it, or delete it. If the window is locked in place, it'll turn light green. Click on the recordings again to unlock it.</p>

<img src="images/sb_merge.png"></img>

<p>This is the merge portion of the application; here, you select your files (from the supported formats above) for the app to combine them into a recording file.</p>

<p>Before you select your files, you have to put in the time when your audio starts. It should be in HH:MM[AM/PM] format. This is important so your pictures are in the right place when the audio is playing.</p> 

<p>After you put the time in, you can pick your files; make sure they're in the data folder.</p>

<p> Once you pick your files, a new recording should appear on the left. You can load it and use StudyBuddy.</p>
